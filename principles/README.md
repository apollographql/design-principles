# Apollo Design Principles

## What are design principles?

These principles are meant to help guide and inform design decisions, and how we build and ship product at Apollo. They are about starting from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle), and they are the principles we can always go back to and start from. To learn more, see [Prior Art](#prior-art).

## Context

We initially set out to come up with a list of unified principles for our design group, but during our first exercise it became clear that seeing each person's principles was really valuable as a way to understand how each team member sees and thinks.

We decided to preserve this format and run with it, inviting each team to document the individual principles of their own team members. This repository is a work in progress to that end.

Over time as each team and team member adds their own principles, we should notice common themes emerging. Eventually we could extract and codify a set of unified company-wide principles that represent our aggregate set, and align with other company wide ideals (like our values).

## How to contribute your principles

*(for Apollo staff only)*

Check to see if your team has already started a principles doc (check the repository root files list above). 

If so, feel free to add your name and principles to the doc by editing the document (here on GitHub, or by checking out the repository locally) and then opening a [pull request](https://github.com/apollographql/design-principles/pulls). Over time, you can always add to or edit your list as you gain clarity on your own principles (part of the joy and intention behind this exercise is to help us think and see with design principles lenses more intentionally! :sparkles::eyeglasses::sparkles:)

If your team does not have a principles doc yet, feel free to be the first to add one! There are two ways to approach this with your team, and it's quite up to you (and your team). 

The first way is to simply add a new markdown file, drop your name in, and add your princples. Then share the link with your team in Slack and let them know you've kicked it off.

The second way is a more hands on option. If you think your team might enjoy and benefit from working collaboratively together on your team design principles, you could setup a 45 minute design principles workshop together to kick it off! 

Don't worry, there are [facilitation guidelines](#facilitating-a-design-principles-workshop-with-your-team) below and it's a pretty simple exercise. The benfit of this option is that it gives your team a chance to come together synchronously and think from the same starting point. It does require everyone having time in their schedule to meet this way, so please be sure to check with your team (or team manager) out of consideration before you plan it.

## Facilitating a design principles workshop with your team

If you've decided to do a design principles workshop, here are some recommendations for format and how to facilitate it. Feel free to customize your experience, these are just general guidelines, not rules. :wink:

- Find a time that works for your whole team to meet for 45-60 minutes (45 minutes is a nice block to aim for, plus it gives you some buffer if conversation goes over).
- Prior to the session, open a pull request in this repo to add a placeholder file for your team's principles.
- Start the exercise by reviewing what design principles are, and take a look at some of the existing examples together (you could review some of our team's existing principles, and some of the examples from prior art). *Approx 10 minutes*
- Next, set a timer, for 15 minutes and give everyone a chance to write their own principles (playing some [chill music](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=chill%20hop) can be a nice touch for this part). *15 min*
  - Consider using a collaborative space where everyone can work together, like a Google Doc, a Quip file, or a post-it notes board in [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/). For example, when we did this exercise with the design group, our space [looked like this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw66r9rjsmagljc/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-02%20at%208.27.11%20AM.png?dl=0).
  - Refer to the [getting started questions](#getting-started-questions) to help give your team a baseline to build their principles from.
- Finally, once everone has finished writing their principles, take the remaining time to let each team member share their principles and any comments or context they'd like to provide. *Aprox 15-25 min*
- After the session, invite your team to add their principles to your team's file in the repository. As the facilitator you could offer to add principles for anyone who is not entirely comfortable with editing files on GitHub, or offer to walk them through it so they can learn. It's also helpful to encourage team members to add their own principles so they can feel a sense of ownership in the shared project artifact, and so they can feel comfortable with editing the file later as they refine their principles.

If you have any questions about facilitating the exercise, or anything else related to this project, feel free to ping [@jglovier](http://github.com/jglovier/) or another member of the design team for help. :smile:

## Getting started questions
1. What guiding principles do you use in your practice of design creation that would be helpful to codify into a principle?
2. What patterns have you noticed in executing work with your team that would be helpful to acknowledge and codify into a principle?
3. What external constraints do we regularly face that would be helpful to account for by codifying into a principle?
4. What measures of success do we use that would be helpful to codify into a principle?
5. What values do we have that could be helpful to codify into a principle?
