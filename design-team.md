## Joel's principles
(*needs some consolidation*) ðŸ™ˆ
- Identify the jobs a feature or workflow needs to solve. Don't give the feature/workflow/UI component too many jobs (keep a relatively simple mapping of job to component).
- Identify constraints and work within them. ("Embrace constraints")
- Always be shipping.
- Iterate often.
- Favor unblocking over blocking.
- Embrace the seasonality of a project process. Take time to listen (research), and time to process and consider. Break the problem wide open. Start with story, and identify/build a clear narrative. Explore designs at the lowest possible fidelity level. Negotiate for alignment and scope. Participate in the build. Guide the ship. Take time to sharpen the saw, rest, and reflect before starting again.
- Design is a communication tool, not just implementation instructions. Use design to drive the conversation, and help people communicate their vision.
- Favor unblocking over blocking. Momentum is precious.
- Disagree and commit.
- Simplify wherever possible. Aim for approachable when simple is not possible.
- Time is of the essence.
- Focus on workflows, not features.
- Workflows happen in the context of story, so be sure to tell the story.
- Show what's possible. Dream big.
- User research is everyone's responsiblity. We are all advocates for our customers.
- Prioritize customers problems over theoretical use cases.
- Anything added dilutes everything else.
- Throughput beats perfection.
- Shorten the journey by removing friction.
- All feedback is a gift.
- Suprise and delight.
- Use whimsey to create a fun space to work.
- Copy is UI too.
- Embrace the journey. The best experiences are often cultivated over time, not simply launched at once.
- Listen carefully to others, listen for their perspective and look at what they are seeing, and include it in your own perspective. Tell a compelling story, and bring everyone along for the ride.

## Danielle's principles

- The details make the cake. Micro interactions matter.
- "Anyone Can Design" (spoken in the Gaston accent of "Anyone Can Cook") â€“â€“Â as in, great ideas and inspiration can come from anywhere and unexpected places.
- "Whack the moles". We should fix small, easy wins on the spot â€“â€“ not walk by them.
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop (thanks Zari!).
- Disagree and commit (thanks Joel!).
- Ship it and iterate â€“â€“Â opening the first door will help you figre out what the next doors even are.
- Favor doing over deliberating, trying over deciding, asking for foreginess instead of asking for permission.
- Prototyping is key â€“â€“Â sometimes you have to play with something to know what feels right and what doesn't.

## Zari's principles

- Design is a partner, not a service
- Consistent is better than custom
- Overcommunication is better than ambiguity
- Showing/disabling is better than hiding
- Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
- Never lose sight of the new user when designing for the power user
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop
- Asking questions demonstrates strength, not ignorance
- Accessibility is not optional

## Tim's principles

- Determine user needs first.
- Consistency is key.
- Try things, learn, and iterate later.
- Solicit feedback shamelessly.
- Make (informed) decisions for users.
- Great products offer simplicity and transparency.
- Don't aim for "Wow!" Aim for "Of course!"
- Scalability matters. Design for the future.
- Obvious--and preferably singular--solutions.

## Carlos' principles
- Empower others.
- Take in to consideration your userâ€™s mental model.
- Transparency over ambiguity.
- Fail fast, fail early.
- Aim to minimize the possibility of errors but they are bound to happen, help users overcome them.
- Donâ€™t be afraid of change.
- It's never a bad time for feedback. 

## Desiree's principles
- Strive for intuitive solutions
- Design for everyone, understand accessibility
- Always seek feedback
- Details make the experience
- Be mindful of the design process
- Be consistent, not uniform

## Ana's principles
- Ethical design helps us move beyond empathy and towards compassion for the user
- Focus on inclusive design, on creating access and preventing (or removing) obstacles
- Ensure every design decision, no matter how small, is rooted in intentionality and advocacy
- Consider accessibility from the start, and factor it into every decision
- Prioritize functionality and must-haves, but remember that details matter
- Focus on asking and answering *why* before moving into *how*
- Design is a conversationâ€”it's important to build and maintain our relationship with users (Ship â†’ Learn â†’ Iterate â†’ Repeat!)
- Design is a strategic business partner that can help drive impactful outcomes and metrics
- Consistency and familiarity are essential (question/challenge patterns when appropriate)
- Constraints are opportunities for creativity
